# MPAL (Motion Pattern Analysis)
### A Python Open Source Application for the Trajectory Analysis of Hand Motion

The approach used in this app for segmenting and labelling trajectories was inspired by the following article.

Schrum, P., Rintoul, M., & Newton, B. (2018). Curvature based analysis to identify and categorize trajectory subsegments. doi: 10.13140/RG.2.2.25670.93761

## Installation Guide
1. Download the repository and extract it.
2. Open terminal.
3. Install Python 3.7 or above.
3. Install `pip` and `setuptools`.
4. Use `cd` to change directory to the extracted folder.
(E.g., `cd <directory_path>/MPAL-master`)
5. Use `pip install .` to install all dependencies.

## Run MotionTRAJ
1. Open terminal.
2. Use `cd` to change directory to the MotionTRAJ subfolder within the main application folder.
(E.g., `cd <directory_path>/MPAL-master/MPAL`) (You should see *\_\_init\_\_.py*, *app.py*, *analysis.py*, & *preprocessing.py* in this folder)
3. Enter `python3 app.py` to run the application.
